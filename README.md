# Sarcasm Detection

## Overview

Welcome to the Sarcasm Detection repository! This project is dedicated to the development of a sarcasm detection system using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. Sarcasm detection is an essential task in the field of natural language understanding, with applications ranging from sentiment analysis to social media monitoring.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project include:

- Developing a robust and accurate sarcasm detection model.
- Exploring various machine learning and deep learning algorithms for sarcasm detection.
- Creating an easy-to-use Python library or API for sarcasm detection.
- Evaluating the model's performance on different datasets and real-world applications.

## Features

- Preprocessing and text cleaning utilities.
- Implementation of state-of-the-art sarcasm detection models.
- Evaluation metrics for model performance.
- Example code and notebooks for using the sarcasm detection model.
- A user-friendly interface for quick integration.

## Getting Started

To get started with sarcasm detection, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbuthi/sarcasm_detection_model
cd sarcasm_detection_model
```

2. Create a virtual environment using `virtualenv` (assuming you have `virtualenv` installed).

```bash
pip install virtualenv  # Install virtualenv if not already installed
virtualenv venv         # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (on Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate')
```

3. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start a Jupyter Notebook server to explore the example notebooks.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a web browser window with access to the Jupyter Notebook interface.

5. Explore the example notebooks to see how the sarcasm detection model works and use the provided utilities to preprocess and analyze text data.
